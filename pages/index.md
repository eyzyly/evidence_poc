title: Storming the Market - How Hurricane Patterns Supercharged Our HD Trading Strategy
---

## TL;DR
- We looked at price trends for Home Improvement stocks (Home Depot, Lowes) during Hurricane Season (June 1 - Nov 30) for the last 10 years
- A naive buy and sell strategy for HD outperformed SPY in the last 10 hurricane seasons 
- Leveraging hurricane data and adjusting the buy time based on a 3 year rolling average of category 0 hurricanes outperforms this baseline

## Story So Far
- Constraint: HD stock only, sell only on Nov 30
- Parameter: What day should I buy? 
- Brought in hurricane characteristics which include year, region, severity, start and end period  (333 rows)    
- Learned the hurricane pattern
- Our initial strategy is based on the assumption that hurricane season in the Atlantic region starts June 1st and ends Nov 30th and this aligns with category 0 hurricanes first appearing beginning end of May/early June. The first category 1 hurricanes occur on average 42 days after the start of hurricane season whereas category 2 hurricanes and higher first appear 81 days after the start of hurricane season.
- New Strategy: Would investing 40 days later or 80 days later to align with the first appearances of category 1 or 2 hurricanes increase our return? 
- Tried to time investment based on cat 1/cat 2 hurricane timing. results were not better than baseline
- Noticed cat 0 is happening earlier than june 1st (by 2-5 days)
- What if we adjust the buy period based on the first appearance of category 0 hurricanes?
- use last 3 years of history and buy based on the delta. Call this 3 year rolling avg hurricane start
- Using the new hurricane_start dates, evaluate the performance of the model against baseline
- Using the rolling_avg returns better results than baseline based on 7 years of data across all metrics (average return, median return, std deviation, sharpe ratio)

## Intro

Over the past decade (2014-2023), we analyzed stock price trends for Home Depot (HD) and evaluated a baseline trading strategy: buying HD stock on June 1st and selling on November 30th to align with Atlantic hurricane season. This approach consistently outperformed the S&P 500 (SPY) in the same period. 

```sql stock_prices_hurricane
  select
      *
  from analytics_marts.stock_prices
  WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) BETWEEN 6 AND 11
```

    x=trading_date
    y={['adj_close_hd','adj_close_low','adj_close_spyx']} 
/>

```sql stock_prices_hurricane_annual_returns
  WITH stock_prices AS (
  SELECT 
    trading_date,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trading_date) AS year,
    adj_close_hd,

    adj_close_spyx
  FROM analytics_marts.stock_prices
  WHERE (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 6 AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM trading_date) = 1)
     OR (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 11 AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM trading_date) = 30)
)

SELECT 
  year,
  (MAX(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 11 THEN adj_close_hd END)

```sql baseline_compounded_return

Select *
FROM analytics_marts.baseline_compounded_return

```
<DataTable data={baseline_compounded_return}/>

Motivated by this, we investigated whether incorporating hurricane telemetry (hurricane severity and occurrences)â€”could enhance returns further. The goal was to determine an optimal buy time for HD stock while maintaining the constraint of selling only on November 30th. 

## Cyclone Stats

We analyzed 333 hurricanes between 2014-2023. 2020 had the most hurricane with 47 events, 30 of which were category 0 which represent tropical storms. Hurricanes typically last between 8-9 days while tropical storms last for less than 5 days.

```sql hurricanes_by_year
  Select
    hurricane_year,
    max_severity,
    count(*) as hurricane_counts
  FROM analytics_marts.hurricane_attributes
  group by hurricane_year,max_severity
  
```

<BarChart
    data={hurricanes_by_year}
    x=hurricane_year
    y=hurricane_counts
    series=max_severity
/>

```sql average_hurricane_duration_by_severity
  Select
    max_severity,
     AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (hurricane_enddtg - hurricane_startdtg)) / 3600) / 24 AS avg_duration
  FROM analytics_marts.hurricane_attributes
  group by max_severity
  order by max_severity asc
  
```

<BarChart
    data={average_hurricane_duration_by_severity}
    x=max_severity
    y=avg_duration
    series=max_severity
/>

## Modelling A Hurricane Season

With an idea of how often and how long hurricanes occur in a season, we wanted to understand the timing of different hurricane severity within a season.

```sql hurricane_start_analysis
  Select
    *
  FROM analytics_marts.hurricane_start_analysis
```

```sql hurricane_start_aggregate
  Select
    max_severity,
    count(difference_in_days) as total_count,
    avg(difference_in_days) as avg_difference
  FROM ${hurricane_start_analysis}
  group by max_severity
```

<DataTable data={hurricane_start_aggregate}/>

```sql use_weighted_approach

WITH hurricane_data AS (
  SELECT
    hurricane_year,
    max_severity,
    difference_in_days,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hurricane_year) AS year_numeric
  FROM ${hurricane_start_analysis}
),
weighted_data AS (
  SELECT
    max_severity,
    difference_in_days,
    year_numeric,
    1.0 / (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - year_numeric + 1) AS weight -- Example weight calculation
  FROM hurricane_data
)
SELECT
  max_severity,
  SUM(difference_in_days * weight) / SUM(weight) AS weighted_avg_difference_in_days
FROM weighted_data
GROUP BY max_severity
ORDER BY max_severity ASC


```

Our initial strategy is based on the assumption that hurricane season in the Atlantic region starts June 1st and ends Nov 30th and this aligns with category 0 hurricanes first appearing beginning end of May/early June. The first category 1 hurricanes occur on average 42 days after the start of hurricane season whereas category 2 hurricanes and higher first appear 81 days after the start of hurricane season.

## Hypothesis 1: Would investing 40 days later or 80 days later to align with the first appearances of category 1 or 2 hurricanes increase our return? 

### Strategy 1: Invest 40 days into hurricane season (July 14)

```sql stock_prices_hurricane_annual_returns_july_14
  WITH stock_prices AS (
  SELECT 
    trading_date,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trading_date) AS year,
    adj_close_hd,
    adj_close_low,
    adj_close_spyx
  FROM analytics_marts.stock_prices
  WHERE (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 7 AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM trading_date) = 14)
     OR (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 11 AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM trading_date) = 30)
),
yearly_returns AS (
  SELECT 
    year,
    -- Calculate yearly return for adj_close_hd
    (MAX(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 11 THEN adj_close_hd END) 
     - MIN(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 7 THEN adj_close_hd END)) 
     / MIN(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 7 THEN adj_close_hd END) AS hd_yearly_return,
    
    -- Calculate yearly return for adj_close_low
    (MAX(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 11 THEN adj_close_low END) 
     - MIN(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 7 THEN adj_close_low END)) 
     / MIN(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 7 THEN adj_close_low END) AS low_yearly_return,
    
    -- Calculate yearly return for adj_close_spyx
    (MAX(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 11 THEN adj_close_spyx END) 
     - MIN(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 7 THEN adj_close_spyx END)) 
     / MIN(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 7 THEN adj_close_spyx END) AS spyx_yearly_return
  FROM stock_prices
  GROUP BY year
)
SELECT
  -- Cumulative returns with reinvestment logic
  EXP(SUM(LOG(1 + hd_yearly_return))) - 1 AS hd_cumulative_return,
  EXP(SUM(LOG(1 + low_yearly_return))) - 1 AS low_cumulative_return,
  EXP(SUM(LOG(1 + spyx_yearly_return))) - 1 AS spyx_cumulative_return
FROM yearly_returns

```

### Strategy 2: Invest 80 days into hurricane season (August 20)

```sql stock_prices_hurricane_annual_returns_aug_20
  WITH stock_prices AS (
  SELECT 
    trading_date,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM trading_date) AS year,
    adj_close_hd,
    adj_close_low,
    adj_close_spyx
  FROM analytics_marts.stock_prices
  WHERE (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 8 AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM trading_date) = 20)
     OR (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 11 AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM trading_date) = 30)
),
yearly_returns AS (
  SELECT 
    year,
    -- Calculate yearly return for adj_close_hd
    (MAX(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 11 THEN adj_close_hd END) 
     - MIN(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 8 THEN adj_close_hd END)) 
     / MIN(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 8 THEN adj_close_hd END) AS hd_yearly_return,
    
    -- Calculate yearly return for adj_close_low
    (MAX(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 11 THEN adj_close_low END) 
     - MIN(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 8 THEN adj_close_low END)) 
     / MIN(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 8 THEN adj_close_low END) AS low_yearly_return,
    
    -- Calculate yearly return for adj_close_spyx
    (MAX(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 11 THEN adj_close_spyx END) 
     - MIN(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 8 THEN adj_close_spyx END)) 
     / MIN(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trading_date) = 8 THEN adj_close_spyx END) AS spyx_yearly_return
  FROM stock_prices
  GROUP BY year
)
SELECT
  -- Cumulative returns with reinvestment logic
  EXP(SUM(LOG(1 + hd_yearly_return))) - 1 AS hd_cumulative_return,
  EXP(SUM(LOG(1 + low_yearly_return))) - 1 AS low_cumulative_return,
  EXP(SUM(LOG(1 + spyx_yearly_return))) - 1 AS spyx_cumulative_return
FROM yearly_returns
```

<DataTable data={stock_prices_hurricane_annual_returns_aug_20}/>

Based on the results, this approach is not yielding a good return.
